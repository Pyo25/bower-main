bower-main
===============

Intended to be used with Gulp. Get bower main files in both normal and minimized formats (if available in package).
It uses [bower-main-files](https://www.npmjs.com/package/main-bower-files) and manipulates the result.

## Installation

```shell
  npm install bower-main --save
```

## Usage

Require the module

```js
var bowerMain = require('bower-main');
```

To get a non-minified list of a certain kind of assets, call method 'assets' with the desired file extension, like '.js', '.css' and so on.

```js
bowerMain.assets('.js')
```

To get a minified list of a certain kind of assets, call method 'assetsMinified' with the desired file extension (like above)
and the minified file extension, like '.min.js', '.min.js.gzip', '.min.css' and so on.
If no minified version is found, the original is kept.

```js
bowerMain.assetsMinified('.js','.min.js')
```

## Example with Gulp

```js
var concat = require('gulp-concat');
var bowerMain = require('bower-main');

gulp.task('vendorScriptsDevelopment', function() {
  return gulp.src(bowerMain.assets('.js'))
    .pipe(concat('vendor-scripts.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dev'))
});

gulp.task('vendorScriptsProduction', function() {
  return gulp.src(bowerMain.assetsMinified('.js','.min.js'))
    .pipe(concat('vendor-scripts.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('dist'))
});
```
